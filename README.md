# Extreme-Human-Video-Compression-with-Multi-granularity-Temporal-Trajectory-Factorization
+ We propose a novel Multi-granularity Temporal Trajectory Factorization (MTTF) framework for extreme human video compression, which holds great potential for
bandwidth-constrained human-centered video streaming.
+ In particular, the proposed motion factorization strategy can facilitate to implicitly characterize the high-dimensional visual signal into compact motion vectors for representation compactness and further transform these vectors into a fine-grained field for motion expressibility. As such, the coded bit-stream can be entailed with enough visual motion information at the lowest representation cost. 
+ Meanwhile, a resolution-expandable generative module is developed with enhanced background stability, such that the proposed framework can be optimized towards higher reconstruction robustness and more flexible resolution adaptation.
+ Experimental results show that proposed method outperforms latest generative models and the state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC) on both talking-face videos and movingbody videos in terms of both objective and subjective quality.
